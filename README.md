PolyEFluc
===========================================

PolyEFluc is the code for a field theory-based approach to predicting the dynamics of materials composed of charged polymers, or polyelectrolytes, under a variety of chemical compositions and conditions.

# Running the script

## High Performance Computing Clusters

Depending on the timescale of the dynamics that one wishes to see, the code may need to be run on a cluster. I have included the PBS script that I use to run the code as well as the file of parameters for the polyelectrolyte system as examples of how to evaluate the dynamics of a given system composition.
